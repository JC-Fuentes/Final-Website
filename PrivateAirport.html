    Our Private airfield allows us to fly anyone or anything through the skies without being detected by radars. For the right price, we will transport you in secret to your prefered destination to avoid being followed on the ground. We also transport and sell cargo through this airfield. For security purposes, we ask that all cell phones be turned in to our security check-in before boarding the plane. Any other pieces of technology like, laptops, smart-watches, and pagers are strickly prohibited. We also are always looking for pilots who have been certified by the CAA and have at least 5 years of flying experiance. For more information, please visit the contact section of this website.
